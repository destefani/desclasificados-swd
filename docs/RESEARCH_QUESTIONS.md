## Introduction

This document provides a structured list of research questions that should be answerable using the CIA's declassified documents on the Chilean dictatorship (1973-1990). These questions are organized thematically to facilitate systematic research and evaluation of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

**Important Caveat:** These documents represent the CIA's perspective, which may contain intelligence errors, reflect US biases, and is incomplete (many documents remain classified). The complete historical record requires multiple sources including Chilean archives, survivor testimonies, and international human rights reports.

## Methodology Notes

### Using These Questions for RAG Evaluation

These questions can be used for:

1. **Test Dataset Creation**: Select questions to create a golden dataset for RAG evaluation

2. **Query Testing**: Use questions to test retrieval quality and answer generation

3. **Coverage Assessment**: Determine which topics are well-covered vs. gaps in the document collection

4. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - **Simple**: Single-fact questions (e.g., "When was DINA dissolved?")
   - **Moderate**: Questions requiring synthesis from multiple documents
   - **Complex**: Questions requiring temporal reasoning, comparison, or inference

5. **Question Categories for Testing**:
   - **Factual**: Direct questions with specific answers
   - **Analytical**: Requiring assessment or interpretation
   - **Temporal**: About timing, sequences, or evolution
   - **Comparative**: Comparing CIA assessments across time or topics

### Expected Answer Characteristics

Good answers from the CIA documents should:
- Include specific document IDs and dates
- Note classification levels when relevant
- Acknowledge limitations (e.g., "Documents from this period show...")
- Distinguish between CIA knowledge vs. historical fact
- Identify gaps ("No documents in the collection address...")

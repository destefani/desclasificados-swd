## 9. Key Findings & Research Implications

### 9.1 Letelier Case is Central
With 132 keyword mentions plus 102+ person mentions, the Letelier assassination is the best-documented case in the current corpus. **Recommendation**: Prioritize Case Study 1.

### 9.2 Covert Action Well-Documented
- 90 documents reference "CIA FUNDING"
- 90 reference "COVERT ACTION"
- 86 reference the "40 COMMITTEE"
This provides strong material for Track C (Political Interference).

### 9.3 1970 Election Intervention
Peak documentation in 1970 suggests extensive material on efforts to prevent Allende's election. Documents mentioning "ELECTIONS" (104) combined with covert action references indicate intervention planning.

### 9.4 Operation Condor Underrepresented
- Only 38 DINA mentions
- 48 Argentina mentions (primary Condor partner)
This suggests Condor-specific documents may be in untranscribed portion of corpus.

### 9.5 Post-Coup Gap
Despite 1974-1978 being peak repression years, documentation is sparse. Either:
- Documents not yet transcribed
- Documents not declassified
- Less US engagement during this period

### 9.6 Data Quality Issues
- 10 documents with empty document_type
- 44 documents with empty classification
- 38 documents with "0000" dates
- Name variants need consolidation

## 10. Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 completion)
1. ~~Generate corpus statistics~~ ✓
2. Create consolidated people index (merge name variants)
3. Create timeline visualization
4. Flag documents needing quality review

### Short-term (Phase 2)
1. Begin **Track A: Operation Condor** research - search for CONDOR keyword
2. Begin **Case 1: Letelier** - 132 documents ready for analysis
3. Query RAG system for specific research questions

### Medium-term
1. Prioritize transcription of 1974-1978 documents
2. Cross-reference with Peter Kornbluh's "The Pinochet File"
3. Build relationship network graphs

---

## Appendix: Data Quality Flags

### Documents Needing Review

1. **Empty document_type** (10 documents): Metadata extraction issue
2. **Empty classification** (44 documents): May be partially illegible
3. **Date "0000"** (38 documents): Missing or illegible dates
4. **Name variants**: Multiple entries for same person need consolidation

### Methodology Notes

- Analysis performed on `gpt-5-mini-v2.2.0` transcripts
- Excluded `failed_documents.json` (metadata file, not transcript)
- Counts are case-sensitive; some keywords may have variants

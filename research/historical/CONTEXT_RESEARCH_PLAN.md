# Contextual Research Plan

**Project**: Background Knowledge for Declassified Document Interpretation
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Status**: Planning

## Purpose

This plan addresses **contextual research** - the background knowledge necessary to properly interpret the declassified documents. While the main `RESEARCH_PLAN.md` focuses on analyzing document content, this plan covers:

- Understanding who produced these documents and why
- Historical context of the Cold War in Latin America
- Chilean political system and key actors
- US government structure and intelligence apparatus
- Secondary literature and scholarly interpretations

---

## Success Criteria

The contextual research is complete when a researcher can:

1. **Identify any agency or acronym** appearing in documents
2. **Recognize key individuals** and understand their roles
3. **Place any document in historical context** based on date
4. **Understand document production context** (why this document exists)
5. **Cross-reference with secondary literature** efficiently
6. **Recognize limitations** of the source material

---

## Notes

- This contextual research supports but is distinct from document analysis
- Prioritize sources that directly engage with the same document corpus
- Maintain bibliography in Zotero or similar tool for citation management
- Consider Spanish-language sources for Chilean perspective
- Government reports (Church Committee, Hinchey) are primary sources for US policy context

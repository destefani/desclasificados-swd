# Historical Research

Research related to the declassified CIA documents on the Chilean dictatorship (1973-1990).

## Two Research Tracks

This research is organized into **two separate tracks**:

### Track 1: Document Analysis
**Plan**: `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`

Direct analysis of the declassified document corpus:
- Thematic investigations (Operation Condor, human rights, etc.)
- Case studies (Letelier assassination, coup, etc.)
- Network analysis of actors and organizations
- Timeline construction from documents

### Track 2: Contextual Research
**Plan**: `CONTEXT_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`

Background knowledge to interpret documents:
- US government structure and agencies
- Chilean political history and actors
- Cold War regional context
- Secondary literature review
- Document interpretation methodology

## Research Methodology

All research should follow these guidelines:

1. **Source Documents**: Always reference specific document IDs from `data/generated_transcripts/`
2. **Citations**: Include document_id, date, and relevant metadata
3. **Cross-references**: Link related findings across themes and cases
4. **Verification**: Note confidence levels and corroborating sources
5. **Gaps**: Document what information is missing or redacted

## Document Corpus Status

- **Total PDFs**: ~21,512 documents
- **Transcribed**: 339+ (in progress)
- **Date Range**: Primarily 1970-1990
- **Sources**: CIA, State Department, NSC, other agencies

## Getting Started

See `RESEARCH_PLAN.md` for the comprehensive research plan and prioritized research questions.

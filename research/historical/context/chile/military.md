# Chilean Military (1970-1990)

Understanding the military structure is essential for interpreting documents about the coup and dictatorship.

---

## Pre-Coup Military Tradition

Chile's military had a tradition of **non-intervention** in politics:
- Professional officer corps
- Constitutional loyalty
- No coups since 1932 (41 years)
- Army Commander General René Schneider strongly opposed political involvement

This tradition made the 1973 coup significant and required CIA efforts to find willing officers.

## Military Branches

### Chilean Army (Ejército de Chile)

**Role**: Ground forces, largest branch
**Significance**: Pinochet was Army Commander; Army dominated the junta

| Commander | Period | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| René Schneider | 1969-1970 | Constitutionalist, assassinated in Track II plot |
| Carlos Prats | 1970-1973 | Loyalist to Allende, resigned August 1973, assassinated 1974 |
| Augusto Pinochet | Aug-Sept 1973 | Appointed by Allende, led coup |

### Chilean Navy (Armada de Chile)

**Role**: Naval forces
**Significance**: **First to plot coup**; Navy officers initiated coup planning

| Commander | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Raúl Montero | Commander, Allende loyalist - sidelined |
| José Toribio Merino | Coup plotter, became junta member |

**Key fact**: The Navy began coup planning before the Army. Admiral Montero was isolated (phones cut, cars sabotaged) to prevent him from stopping the coup.

### Chilean Air Force (Fuerza Aérea de Chile)

**Role**: Air forces
**Significance**: Bombed La Moneda presidential palace on September 11, 1973

| Commander | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Gustavo Leigh | Junta member, ordered palace bombing |

Leigh later opposed Pinochet's consolidation of power and was dismissed in 1978.

### Carabineros de Chile

**Role**: National police force (militarized)
**Significance**: Fourth branch of armed forces

| Commander | Role |
|-----------|------|
| César Mendoza | Junta member |

## The Military Junta (1973-1990)

### Original Members (September 11, 1973)

| Name | Branch | Initial Role |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Augusto Pinochet | Army | President of Junta (later sole ruler) |
| José Toribio Merino | Navy | Junta member |
| Gustavo Leigh | Air Force | Junta member (dismissed 1978) |
| César Mendoza | Carabineros | Junta member |

### Original Plan

The junta originally planned **rotating presidency** among the four commanders. Pinochet consolidated power instead.

### Power Consolidation

1. **December 1974**: Pinochet declared "Supreme Chief of the Nation"
2. **1978**: Leigh dismissed for opposing permanent military rule
3. **1980**: New constitution institutionalized Pinochet's rule
4. **1988**: Lost plebiscite, forced to accept transition

## Who Masterminded the Coup?

**Common misconception**: Pinochet masterminded the coup.

**Reality**:
- **Navy officers** initiated coup plotting
- Pinochet was informed only **3 days before** (September 8, 1973)
- Army generals were unsure of Pinochet's loyalties until the last moment
- Pinochet was seen as recently appointed and without prior disloyalty to Allende

Pinochet later claimed (in his book "The Decisive Day") that he was the mastermind, but other junta members like Leigh contradicted this.

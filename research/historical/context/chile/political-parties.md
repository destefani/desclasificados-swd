Understanding Chile's multi-party system is essential for interpreting the documents.

## The Three-Way Split

Chilean politics before the coup was characterized by a three-way division:

| Bloc | Parties | Ideology |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Right** | National Party (PN) | Conservative, pro-business |
| **Center** | Christian Democrats (PDC) | Reform-minded, anti-communist |
| **Left** | Popular Unity (UP) coalition | Socialist, communist |

This three-way split was crucial to the 1970 election, where Allende won with only 36.3% of the vote.

## Popular Unity (Unidad Popular, UP)

### 1970 Election Result

Allende won with **36.3%** of the vote against:

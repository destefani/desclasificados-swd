## Communication Types

### Cable / Telegram

**Definition**: Confidential text-based message exchanged electronically between diplomatic missions and headquarters.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Fast (same-day delivery) |
| **Transmission** | Electronic (originally via undersea cables, later encrypted radio/satellite) |
| **Length** | Typically concise due to historical cost per word |
| **Security** | Encrypted, classified |
| **Still used** | Yes (now via secure electronic systems) |

**Terminology**: "Cable" and "telegram" are used interchangeably in State Department parlance. The term "cable" derives from undersea telegraph cables.

**Common Formats**:
- **SECSTATE** (Secretary of State) to Embassy
- **AMEMBASSY** (American Embassy) to State Department
- **CIA Station** to CIA Headquarters (Langley)

### Airgram

**Definition**: Diplomatic communication sent by physical courier via diplomatic pouch.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Slower (days to weeks) |
| **Transmission** | Physical via diplomatic bag/airmail |
| **Length** | Could be longer, with enclosures |
| **Cost** | Lower than telegrams |
| **Period** | 1942-1991 (discontinued) |

**Two Periods**:
1. **1942-1962**: Essentially telegrams sent in hardcopy, telegraphic style
2. **1962-1991**: More like detailed reports, plain language, with enclosures

Airgrams were used for less time-sensitive reporting and analysis. They often contained more detailed information than cables.

### Memorandum

**Definition**: Internal document for record-keeping or communication within an agency.

**Types**:
- **Memorandum of Conversation (MemCon)**: Record of meeting or discussion
- **Memorandum for the Record**: Documentation of events for files
- **Action Memorandum**: Requests decision from superior
- **Information Memorandum**: Provides information, no decision needed

**Relevance**: Memoranda dominate our corpus (53%), suggesting most documents are internal policy discussions.

### Letter

**Definition**: Formal correspondence, often between officials or agencies.

More personal than memoranda, may indicate relationship between sender and recipient.

### Report / Intelligence Brief

**Definition**: Analytical documents synthesizing information.

- **Intelligence Brief**: Short summary for senior officials
- **Report**: Longer analytical document

### Meeting Minutes

**Definition**: Record of formal meetings, including attendees and decisions.

Particularly valuable for documenting policy decisions (e.g., 40 Committee meetings).

## Classification Levels

### Standard Levels (Lowest to Highest)

| Level | Meaning | Damage from Disclosure |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| **UNCLASSIFIED** | No classification required | None expected |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | Requires protection | Could cause **damage** to national security |
| **SECRET** | Higher protection required | Could cause **serious damage** to national security |
| **TOP SECRET** | Highest standard protection | Could cause **exceptionally grave damage** to national security |

### Damage Scale

Each level represents approximately **10x more damage** than the level below it:
- SECRET disclosure = ~10x damage of CONFIDENTIAL
- TOP SECRET disclosure = ~10x damage of SECRET

### Special Markings

Beyond classification levels, documents may have additional markings:

| Marking | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **NODIS** | No Distribution (extremely limited) |
| **EXDIS** | Exclusive Distribution |
| **LIMDIS** | Limited Distribution |
| **EYES ONLY** | For named recipient only |
| **NOFORN** | No Foreign Nationals |
| **ORCON** | Originator Controlled |

### In Our Corpus

From Phase 1 analysis (450 documents):
- UNCLASSIFIED: 55.0%
- SECRET: 26.6%
- CONFIDENTIAL: 8.2%
- TOP SECRET: 0.2% (only 1 document)

The predominance of lower classifications suggests:
1. Most sensitive materials may not be in the corpus
2. Documents were downgraded before release
3. Heavy redaction occurred before declassification

| **SLUGLINE** | Topic identifier at top |
| **DATE-TIME GROUP** | When message was sent |

| **REFERENCE** | Related previous messages |

### Distribution Lists

### Redactions

- **Sources and methods** protection
- **Ongoing operations** protection
- **Personal privacy** concerns
- **Foreign government information**

Common redaction patterns:

- `[1 line(s) not declassified]` - Specific quantity redacted

## Reading Tips

### Telegraphic Style

Older cables use abbreviated style to save transmission costs:
- Articles (a, the) often omitted
- Sentences abbreviated
- Technical jargon prevalent

### Bureaucratic Language

- **"Note" or "observe"** = Important point follows
- **"It is suggested"** = Recommendation
- **"Recommend"** = Formal proposal
- **"Authorized"** = Approval granted
- **"Eyes only"** = Extremely sensitive

### Context Clues

- **Multiple drafts** suggest contentious topic
- **Wide distribution** suggests routine matter
- **Restricted distribution** suggests sensitivity
- **Quick response** suggests urgency

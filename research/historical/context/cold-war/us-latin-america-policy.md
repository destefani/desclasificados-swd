# US Latin America Policy (Cold War Era)

Understanding the broader policy context for US intervention in Chile.

---

## The Cold War Framework

US policy toward Latin America during the Cold War was driven by:

1. **Containment** - Preventing spread of Soviet influence
2. **Monroe Doctrine** - Keeping European/Soviet powers out of hemisphere
3. **Anti-communism** - Opposing leftist governments
4. **Economic interests** - Protecting US investments

## Policy Evolution by Administration

|--------|--------|
| NSC 5412 (1954) | Established covert action oversight framework |
| Guatemala coup (1954) | CIA overthrew Arbenz - template for Chile |
| Anti-communism priority | Set tone for Cold War interventions |

### Kennedy (1961-1963)

**Alliance for Progress** (1961):
- $20 billion in US aid over 10 years
- Goal: Economic development to prevent "second Cuba"
- Reform-oriented approach
- Mixed results - many reforms not implemented

**Key events**:
- Bay of Pigs (1961) - Failed Cuba invasion
- Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) - Peak Cold War tension
- Increased military training for Latin American forces

**Chile specific**:
- CIA support began for Christian Democrats
- Eduardo Frei seen as reformist alternative to left

### Johnson (1963-1969)

| Action | Year | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Brazil coup supported | 1964 | Military overthrow of Goulart |
| Dominican Republic intervention | 1965 | Direct military intervention |
| CIA support for Frei | 1964 | ~$2.6 million for election |
| Alliance for Progress continued | - | Increasingly security-focused |

**Chile specific**:
- Massive covert support for Frei's 1964 election
- Frei defeats Allende with CIA backing

### Nixon/Ford (1969-1977)

**Nixon Doctrine** (1969):
- Less direct intervention
- Support for regional allies to maintain stability
- "Let Asians fight Asians" applied globally

**Key officials**:

- Richard Helms - CIA Director

**Chile policy**:

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| 1970 (pre-election) | "Spoiling" operation against Allende |
| September 1970 | Track I (political) and Track II (coup) |
| 1970-1973 | $8 million destabilization |
| 1973 | Supported coup aftermath |
| 1973-1976 | Close relations with Pinochet regime |

**Key Nixon quotes**:
- "Make the economy scream" (September 15, 1970)

### Carter (1977-1981)

**Human rights policy**:
- Made human rights central to foreign policy
- Created Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs
- Reduced military aid to abusive regimes
- Criticized Chile, Argentina, other dictatorships

**Impact on Chile**:

## Key Policy Concepts

### Containment

**Origin**: George Kennan's "Long Telegram" (1946)
**Application to Latin America**:
- Prevent Soviet influence in Western Hemisphere
- Support anti-communist governments regardless of human rights
- Justify covert intervention against leftist movements

### Domino Theory

If one country "falls" to communism, neighbors will follow.

**Application to Chile**:
- Chile seen as potential "second Cuba"
- Allende victory could inspire leftist movements elsewhere
- Justified aggressive intervention

### School of the Americas

US Army training facility in Panama Canal Zone:
- Trained 54,270 Latin American military personnel (1950-1970)
- Counterinsurgency techniques
- Many graduates involved in human rights abuses
- Called "School of Assassins" by critics

## Cuba Factor

The 1959 Cuban Revolution fundamentally shaped US policy:

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Threat perception** | Fear of "second Cuba" |
| **Policy response** | Alliance for Progress, increased intervention |
| **Surveillance** | Monitoring of leftist movements |
| **Chile** | Allende's friendship with Castro heightened concern |

Cuba normalized relations with Chile under Allende, reinforcing US concerns.

## Economic Dimensions

### US Investments

Chile had significant US corporate presence:
- **Copper mining**: Anaconda, Kennecott
- **ITT Corporation**: Telecommunications
- Other manufacturing and extractive industries

### Nationalization Threat

Allende's nationalization program threatened US investments:
- Copper mines nationalized (1971)
- ITT actively opposed Allende
- Economic interests aligned with political goals

### Economic Warfare

US economic pressure on Allende:
- "Make the economy scream" (Nixon)
- Blocked international loans
- Reduced aid
- Supported opposition strikes

## Covert Action History

### Pre-Chile Interventions

| Country | Year | Type |
|---------|------|------|
| Guatemala | 1954 | CIA coup (Operation PBSUCCESS) |
| Cuba | 1961 | Bay of Pigs invasion |
| Brazil | 1964 | Support for military coup |
| Dominican Republic | 1965 | Direct military intervention |

These operations provided templates and experience for Chile intervention.

### Chile's Significance

Chile was different because:
- **Democratic election** - Allende won legitimate vote
- **Constitutional process** - No armed insurgency
- **Developed democracy** - Long constitutional tradition
- **International attention** - "Peaceful road to socialism" watched globally

This made intervention more controversial and required more covert approach.

## Declassification

### Clinton Era (1990s)

Clinton ordered declassification of documents related to:
- US-Chile relations
- US-Argentina relations
- Operation Condor

This revealed extent of US involvement previously denied.

### Ongoing

FOIA requests continue to release new documents. The corpus being analyzed is part of this declassification effort.

---

## Relevance to Document Corpus

Documents reflect policy across administrations:
- **1970 peak** (68 documents): Allende election crisis
- **1973**: Coup and aftermath
- **1976**: Letelier case
- **Post-1976**: Carter-era human rights concerns

Understanding policy evolution helps interpret document tone and priorities.

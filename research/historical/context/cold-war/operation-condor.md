## Founding

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| November 25, 1975 | First Meeting of National Intelligence in Santiago |

The meeting was held during Pinochet's 60th birthday. Manuel Contreras (DINA director) convened intelligence chiefs from member countries.

Chile was designated as the **operational center**.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Condortel (Communications)

Secure communications network connecting member intelligence services:
- Main base located at **US facility in Panama Canal Zone**
- Modeled after CIA's Phoenix Program computer system
- Used Hagelin encryption machines (supplied by Brazil, later Argentina)
- CIA supplied infrastructure including computers

**Crypto AG revelation**: The CIA secretly owned Swiss company Crypto AG, which supplied encryption machines to Condor nations - allowing US to monitor their communications.

### 2. Condoreje (Operations)

Operational coordination axis:
- Forward command in **Buenos Aires**
- Processed intelligence on targets
- Planned and executed abductions
- Coordinated cross-border operations

### 3. Central Database (Santiago)

Computerized information center:
- Collated intelligence from member countries
- Maintained files on targets
- Chile maintained the central repository

## Operations

### Types of Operations

1. **Intelligence sharing** - Basic information exchange
2. **Joint surveillance** - Tracking targets across borders
3. **Renditions** - Capturing targets in one country for another
4. **Assassinations** - Eliminating targets in any country

### Key Assassinations Attributed to Condor

| Date | Target | Location | Perpetrator |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| September 30, 1974 | Carlos Prats (Chilean general) | Buenos Aires | DINA |
| October 6, 1975 | Bernardo Leighton (Chilean politician) | Rome | DINA (survived) |
| June 1976 | Zelmar Michelini & Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz (Uruguayan politicians) | Buenos Aires | Joint operation |
| September 21, 1976 | Orlando Letelier (Chilean diplomat) | Washington DC | DINA |

### Phase 3: Operations Outside Latin America

The most aggressive phase involved operations in:
- **United States** (Letelier assassination)
- **Europe** (Leighton attempted assassination in Rome)
- France (planned operations, not all executed)

This phase proved most problematic as it could not be kept hidden.

## US Knowledge and Involvement

### Early Knowledge

US government agencies had **early knowledge** of Condor's scope:
- CIA reports documented Condor structure
- State Department cables tracked operations
- DIA reports described communications system

### Level of Involvement

| Aspect | US Role |
|--------|---------|
| **Communications** | Condortel used US facility in Panama |
| **Infrastructure** | CIA supplied computers |
| **Encryption** | US monitored through Crypto AG |
| **Training** | School of the Americas trained officers |
| **Intelligence** | CIA shared information with DINA |

### Official Denials

US involvement was "steadfastly denied and covered up" until Clinton-era declassification in late 1990s.

### Key Documents

- CIA cable (February 1977): "All countries belonging to the Condor organization maintain communications..."
- FBI document (September 1976): Argentina, Uruguay, Chile showed "most enthusiasm"
- DIA report (late 1977): Described Condortel equipment

## Regional Intelligence Agencies

| Country | Agency | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Chile** | DINA (1973-1977), CNI (1977-1990) | Primary coordinator |
| **Argentina** | SIDE (Secretaría de Inteligencia del Estado) | Key operational partner |
| **Argentina** | Triple A (paramilitary) | Death squads |
| **Uruguay** | SID | Extensive detention system |
| **Paraguay** | La Técnica / Stroessner apparatus | Archive discovered 1992 |
| **Brazil** | SNI (Serviço Nacional de Informações) | Provided equipment |
| **Bolivia** | Various (regime changes) | Complicated picture |

---

## Paraguay Archive Discovery (1992)

In December 1992, the "Archive of Terror" was discovered in Paraguay:
- Detailed records of Condor operations
- Documentation of cross-border coordination
- Lists of victims and operations
- Provided key evidence for prosecutions

---

## End of Condor

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Letelier assassination (1976) | International pressure, FBI investigation |
| Carter human rights policy (1977) | US pressure on regimes |
| Democratic transitions (1980s) | End of military regimes |
| Investigations (1990s-2000s) | Prosecutions of perpetrators |

## Relevance to Document Corpus

### Corpus Statistics

From Phase 1 analysis:
- **DINA**: 38 mentions
- **Argentina**: 48 mentions
- **Uruguay**: 17 mentions
- **Paraguay**: 16 mentions
- **Bolivia**: 12 mentions

### Research Implications

The relatively low DINA count (38) compared to Letelier assassination (132) suggests:
- Condor-specific documents may be in untranscribed portion
- Most detailed Condor documentation may still be classified
- Letelier case is best-documented Condor operation in current corpus

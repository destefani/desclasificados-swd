## State Department vs CIA

### Institutional Tension

| Issue | State Department | CIA |
|-------|------------------|-----|
| **Track II** | Excluded | Conducted operation |
| **Ambassador's role** | Chief of Mission authority | Station chief reported to Langley |
| **Human rights** | Often advocated concern | Operational focus |
| **Transparency** | Diplomatic reporting | Covert action |

### The "Station vs Embassy" Dynamic

CIA stations operate within embassies but:
- Report through CIA chain (not Ambassador)
- May conduct operations Ambassador doesn't know about
- Have separate communications channels

Ambassador Korry famously did not know about Track II operations being conducted from "his" embassy.

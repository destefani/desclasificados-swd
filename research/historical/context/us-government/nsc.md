From 1973-1975, Kissinger held both positions simultaneously:
- **National Security Advisor** (1969-1975)
- **Secretary of State** (1973-1977)

This unprecedented dual role meant he:
- Coordinated interagency policy (NSC role)
- Executed foreign policy (State role)
- Chaired 40 Committee (authorized covert action)

This concentration of power was central to Chile policy.

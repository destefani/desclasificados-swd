# The 40 Committee

**Role**: Sub-Cabinet level body responsible for authorizing CIA covert operations
**Active**: 1970-1976
**Predecessor**: 303 Committee (1964-1970)
**Successor**: Operations Advisory Group (1976)

## Overview

The 40 Committee was a senior interagency group within the Executive Branch whose mandate was to review and authorize proposed major covert actions. It was named after National Security Decision Memorandum 40 (NSDM 40), signed by President Nixon on February 17, 1970.

The committee was central to US covert operations in Chile during the Allende period (1970-1973).

## Evolution of Covert Action Oversight

| Committee | Period | Named After |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 5412 Panel/Special Group | 1954-1964 | NSC 5412 |
| 303 Committee | 1964-1970 | NSAM 303 |
| 40 Committee | 1970-1976 | NSDM 40 |
| Operations Advisory Group | 1976-1977 | Executive Order 11905 |

The name changes often followed public exposure of the previous committee's name. As Kissinger explained to Nixon: "In view of recent mention of the 303 Committee in the public media, the directive changes the committee name to coincide with the number assigned to the NSDM itself."

## The 40 Committee and Chile

### Key Meetings

| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| September 8, 1970 | Discussed response to Allende's election victory |
| September 14, 1970 | Authorized political action to prevent Allende's confirmation |

| April 11, 1972 | Added $965,000 for El Mercurio |
| Various 1970-1973 | Authorized total of $8 million for anti-Allende operations |

### Track I vs Track II

**Track I** (40 Committee approved):
- Political and economic actions
- Support for opposition parties
- Funding for media (El Mercurio)
- Economic destabilization

**Track II** (Bypassed 40 Committee):
- Direct military coup plotting
- Ordered by Nixon on September 15, 1970
- Managed by Kissinger and CIA Deputy Director Thomas Karamessines
- Excluded State Department and Defense Department
- Resulted in assassination of General René Schneider

> "Track II was never discussed at a 40 Committee meeting."

## Meeting Frequency

The 40 Committee met far less frequently than its predecessors:

| Committee | Meetings per Year |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Special Group | ~Weekly |
| 303 Committee (Kissinger era) | 18 (1969), 19 (1970), 17 (1971) |
| 40 Committee | 1 per year (1972-1975) |

This infrequency limited effective oversight of CIA operations.

## Church Committee Findings

The Church Committee (1975-1976) found that:

1. Only **14%** of CIA covert operations were reviewed by the 40 Committee and its predecessors
2. The committee was often presented with operations **after they had begun**
3. Track II was conducted **entirely outside** 40 Committee oversight
4. Members often lacked detailed knowledge of operations they approved

---

## Key Quotes

**Henry Kissinger** (June 27, 1970):
> "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people."

**Richard Nixon** (September 15, 1970, notes from meeting with CIA Director Helms):
> "1 in 10 chance perhaps, but save Chile!... make the economy scream... 48 hours for plan of action"

**Kissinger to Nixon** (September 16, 1973, after the coup):
> "We didn't do it. I mean we helped them. [Word missing] created the conditions as great as possible."

## Relevance to Document Corpus

When reading declassified documents, references to "40 Committee" indicate:
- Senior-level authorization of covert action
- Formal interagency coordination
- Operations considered significant enough for high-level review

Documents mentioning "Track II" indicate operations that bypassed this oversight.

# Research Directory

This directory contains research notes, analyses, and findings for the Chilean declassified CIA documents project. Research here falls into two main categories:

1. **Technical Research** - Investigation of algorithms, methods, and software implementations
2. **Historical Research** - Analysis and findings from the CIA documents themselves

## Purpose

The research directory serves as a repository for:

### Technical Research
- Algorithm exploration and comparisons (e.g., RAG approaches, LLM performance)
- Software architecture investigations
- Performance benchmarking and optimization studies
- Machine learning methods and experiments
- OCR and vision model evaluations
- Embedding and retrieval technique comparisons

### Historical Research
- Document findings and insights
- Thematic investigations (Operation Condor, human rights, political interference)
- Case studies (Letelier assassination, Caravan of Death, etc.)
- Chronological analyses and timelines
- Network analysis (people, organizations, relationships)
- Academic papers and citations
- Preliminary findings and hypotheses

## Guidelines

- Use markdown for all research notes
- Include sources and citations in all documents
- Date your research entries
- Cross-reference related research files
- Link to specific transcripts using relative paths when referencing documents

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **docs/** - Project documentation, implementation guides, technical specifications, formal documentation
- **research/technical/** - Experimental technical investigations, algorithm comparisons, performance studies
- **research/historical/** - Historical analysis, document findings, thematic investigations
- **notebooks/** - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and quick experiments
- **data/generated_transcripts/** - Source material for historical research
- **app/** - Production code implementations
- **tests/** - Automated tests and test applications

## Getting Started

Create subdirectories as needed based on your research focus. Each major research area should have its own directory with a README explaining the scope and findings.
